## âœ¨ **Key Features**  

- ðŸ›¡ **Payload Placement**  
  Master various techniques to store shellcode securely within different file types and system locations.  

- ðŸ”’ **Payload Encryption**  
  Utilize encryption to obscure payloads and bypass antivirus and endpoint detection solutions.  

- ðŸŒ€ **Payload Obfuscation**  
  Leverage obfuscation strategies to ensure shellcode remains undetected and resilient to signature-based detection.  

- ðŸ§© **Red Team Scenarios**  
  Practical demonstrations for executing payloads in realistic attack scenarios.  

- ðŸ“˜ **Educational Focus**  
  Aimed at empowering both offensive and defensive teams to better understand modern attack vectors.
