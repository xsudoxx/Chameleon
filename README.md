Chameleon



Chameleon is an advanced red-teaming tool designed to demonstrate and simulate modern techniques for concealing and deploying shellcode. Inspired by the natural stealth and adaptability of its namesake, Chameleon enables security professionals to better understand, analyze, and counteract adversarial techniques used to evade detection.

🌟 Features

🛠 Payload Placement

Explore various strategies for embedding shellcode into diverse formats and memory locations.

Simulate real-world scenarios with practical payload placement techniques.

🔒 Payload Encryption

Utilize strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES, XOR) to conceal shellcode during transit.

Generate unique encrypted payloads to bypass antivirus and EDR solutions.

🎭 Payload Obfuscation

Apply multiple layers of obfuscation to hide malicious code signatures.

Showcase obfuscation techniques tailored for bypassing static and dynamic analysis.

🎓 Educational Focus

Practical red-teaming examples for executing hidden payloads.

Training scenarios to help blue teams recognize and defend against these tactics.
